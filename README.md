# offlineViewer
Microsoft will release the source code for our offline viewer for synths and panos in this repository.
This will be done before the end of 2016 and we will announce it on twitter and facebook at that time.
Until then, please install the applications from the locations linked to in this blog post: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/photosynth/2016/10/31/photosynth-to-shut-down/
